Go through the park and around the circle. Then go straight on Main Street to the coffee shop. How far is that? About two miles. Don't go more than two miles. And then am I there? No, there's a big sign: Lang's Drugstore. Turn right at the sign. Then you're there. Park your car and go up the steps. OK. Thanks for the directions, Rita. Yes, I often walk around my city. You see, I often go shopping and in my free time I would like to stay with my friends at the coffee shop. Generally, I am familiar with the roads around my house. I often walk back home along those roads after work, and I can remember their names quite well. Yes, I can. I am ready to help others. I think helping others will make me feel happy and useful. So I would answer othersâ€™ questions with patience. How many blocks should the man go before he turns left? Where should the man turn left? What does he often do in his free time? How does he go home after work? What does he think of helping others? ";

Some will burn their faces, wind will sear them, but they will feel fortunate to have become part of a great adventure. For thousands of years, as human beings spread across the planet, no one came here. Antarctica was as remote as the moon. Ancient Greeks reasoned that the world was round, and that there must be a great southern continent. They imagined a land of strange beasts. It was the greatest mystery on Earth.",
            "It is dawn and the sun is rising, as it has every day for the last 5 billion years. It has been a constant golden disk, shining its unchanging light onto the Earth. But look through the glare, and the true face of the sun is revealed. Not constant, but constantly changing. To understand the sun is to understand the forces that drive the universe. If we can control those forces, we can unlock the power of the stars. All life on Earth owes its existence to the sun. It powers every natural system and sustains every plant and animal."};
