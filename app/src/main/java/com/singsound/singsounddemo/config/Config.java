Go two blocks and turn left. Pardon? Do I turn left at the bank? No, don't turn left at the bank. Turn left at the post office. At the post office? Yes. There. Turn left there. Then what? Go through the park and around the circle. Then go straight on Main Street to the coffee shop. How far is that? About two miles. Don't go more than two miles. And then am I there? No, there's a big sign: Lang's Drugstore. Turn right at the sign. Then you're there. Park your car and go up the steps. OK. Thanks for the directions, Rita. Yes, I often walk around my city. You see, I often go shopping and in my free time I would like to stay with my friends at the coffee shop. Generally, I am familiar with the roads around my house. I often walk back home along those roads after work, and I can remember their names quite well. Yes, I can. I am ready to help others. I think helping others will make me feel happy and useful. So I would answer othersâ€™ questions with patience. How many blocks should the man go before he turns left? Where should the man turn left? What does he often do in his free time? How does he go home after work? What does he think of helping others? ";
